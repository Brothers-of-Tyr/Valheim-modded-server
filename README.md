Installation

Drop this folder in to the base directory of your Valheim install
It is recommended you make a copy / backup of your character and worlds also clone your client to a folder like Valheim - BTYR modded or somethign that you can rememebr. 

This is not compatiable with the vanilla experience and you will need to clone your vanilla client and the drop all the files. 

They need to go in the C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim - Moded client\

Where C is your install drive and assuming you are using steam folder and not a steam library else it would be <STEAM LIBRARY>\Valheim - Moded client\
